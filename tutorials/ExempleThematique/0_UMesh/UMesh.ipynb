    "Descending connectivity represents the `(n-1)`-dimensional elements that make up each `n`-dimensional cell (where `n` is the mesh dimension, `mesh-dim`). For example, in a 3D mesh where the cells are volumetric (3D), descending connectivity provides the set of faces (2D surfaces) that form the boundaries of these volumes.  \n",

    "As an example, we aim to extract the internal faces of the `mesh3D` mesh. To achieve this, we need to construct the descending connectivity mesh of `mesh3D` (stored in `mesh3DSurf`). This results in a `(mesh3D.getMeshDimension()-1)`-dimensional mesh, meaning a 2D mesh composed of the faces that bound each of the 3D volume cells of `mesh3D`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The method `MEDCoupling.buildDescendingConnectivity()` computes this mesh and simultaneously returns mapping arrays. These arrays establish the correspondence between cell identifiers in `mesh3D` and those in `mesh3DSurf`, and vice versa.  \n",
    "\n",
    "A face in `mesh3DSurf` is considered internal if and only if it is shared by more than one 3D cell of `mesh3D`. The third and fourth output parameters of the function provide the link between a face and its parent cells (i.e., the volume(s) it delimits). This link is expressed in the indirect index format seen in the first exercise on manipulating the \"indirect index\" format."
